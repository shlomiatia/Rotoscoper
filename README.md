# Animation Player

A web-based animation player with frame management capabilities. Create custom animations by selecting frame ranges from existing animations.

## Features

- ✅ Play/pause animation controls
- ✅ Adjustable frame delay (10ms - 1000ms)
- ✅ Frame range selection (start/end frames)
- ✅ Create new animations from frame ranges
- ✅ Switch between multiple animations
- ✅ Real-time animation statistics

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
python setup.py
```

Or manually:
```bash
pip install Flask==2.3.3 Flask-CORS==4.0.0
```

### 2. Prepare Animation Frames

Make sure your animation frames are in the `Source/Walk/` directory with the naming pattern:
```
Source/Walk/frame_000_delay-0.03s.gif
Source/Walk/frame_001_delay-0.03s.gif
...
Source/Walk/frame_149_delay-0.03s.gif
```

### 3. Start the Server

```bash
python server.py
```

### 4. Open the Application

Navigate to: http://localhost:5000

## Usage

### Basic Playback
- Use **Play/Pause** button to control animation
- Adjust **Delay** slider to change playback speed
- Use **Frame** slider to scrub through frames

### Creating New Animations
1. Set **Start Frame** and **End Frame** to select your range
2. Enter a **New animation name**
3. Click **Create Animation**
4. The new animation will be created and automatically selected

### Switching Animations
- Use the **Animation dropdown** to switch between created animations
- Each animation maintains its own frame count and range

## API Endpoints

The Flask server provides these endpoints:

- `GET /api/animations` - List all animations
- `POST /api/animations` - Create new animation from frame range
- `GET /api/animations/{name}/frames` - Get animation info
- `DELETE /api/animations/{name}` - Delete animation (except original)

## Technical Details

### Server-Side Features
- **Frame copying**: Copies selected frame ranges to new folders
- **Automatic renaming**: Renumbers frames sequentially (0, 1, 2, ...)
- **Validation**: Checks for duplicate names, invalid ranges
- **CORS support**: Enables cross-origin requests

### Client-Side Features
- **Dynamic loading**: Fetches available animations from server
- **Real-time updates**: Updates UI based on server responses
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for network issues

## Troubleshooting

### Server won't start
- Check that Python 3.6+ is installed
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check that port 5000 is available

### No animations visible
- Ensure `Source/Walk/` directory exists
- Check that frame files follow naming pattern: `frame_XXX_delay-0.03s.gif`
- Check browser console for errors

### Animation creation fails
- Verify frame range is valid (start < end)
- Check that source animation exists
- Ensure animation name doesn't already exist

## Development

To modify the application:

1. **Frontend**: Edit `animation-player.html`
2. **Backend**: Edit `server.py`
3. **Restart server** to see changes

The server runs in debug mode by default, so Python changes are auto-reloaded.
